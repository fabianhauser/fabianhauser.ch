I love discovering new things.
I’m a passionate traveller, mountaineer, photographer and lifelong learner. Currently, I'm taking a sabbatical to travel eastern Asia 🌏

Professionally, I've been active in computer science and teaching with a focus on software engineering, applied cryptography and [open source software](./projects).

Before, I was bringing secure and privacy first communication to the general public at [Threema](https://threema.ch/) and giving lectures on Software Engineering at [OST – Fachhochschule Ostschweiz](https://www.ost.ch/).
